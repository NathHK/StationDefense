# StationDefense
Tower defense game made in Unity.

## About

This is a demo game consisting of three levels. Note that it lacks an in-game economy, so the player can build defensive structures at no cost. Despite this, the project is considered finished.

## Note

I plan to write a more detailed README. Expect an update within 12 hours.
